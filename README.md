# Background 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key understanding with being anonymous comes from awareness of what one puts onto the internet consciously and unconsciously. Some conscious information spread on the web can include images and videos posted on social media, while unconscious information can include recent amazon purchases or verification of an email address. The information shared is completely up to the individual, but most commonly, said individual does not have the understanding or knowledge for when it is appropriate to remain anonymous, or even how to become anonymous.
