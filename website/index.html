    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>Privacy and Security knowledge are crucial while browsing through the internet. Individuals utilize the internet in various different ways including social media, shopping, working, etc. Websites and social media platforms tend to store and sell user information for their personal benefit. This creates a magnitude of individuals personal information including name, location, email, and technological information such as Internet Protocol address (IP) to be potentially publicly available on the internet. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is used by attackers, employers, and other hobbyists to gather and store information about an individual for many various reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>Key understanding with being anonymous comes from awareness of what one puts onto the internet consciously and unconsciously. Some conscious information spread on the web can include images and videos posted on social media, while unconscious information can include recent amazon purchases or verification of an email address. The information shared is completely up to the individual, but most commonly, said individual does not have the understanding or knowledge for when it is appropriate to remain anonymous, or even how to become anonymous.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>The following visualizations contain information regarding individual responses on various Anonymity,
        Internet Privacy, and Internet Security
        questions. The data comes from a July 2013 data survey of different demographics of American individuals and
        their practice of Internet Privacy,
        Security, and Anonymity. Visualizations found on this site are broken into different separate pages and can be
        navigated to using the buttons
        below. Each visualization compares the responses to the survey questions to the demographics of the surveyed
        individuals. Visualizations are hosted on Tableau Public and were created using the Tableau Desktop software.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>The audience for this visualization include average working class individuals with consistent internet usage and potentially little to no understanding of the existence of OSINT and internet anonymity. The purpose of these visualizations will be to assist cybersecurity organizations in informing which demographic of individuals for privacy and anonymity advertising. A controversial effect of the visualization may also include the potential for employers, hackers, and researchers to target a demographic of individuals for OSINT opportunities.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="tab"></span> While these visualization utilize data trends from July of 2013, the trends are still relevant today. Individuals from all different backgrounds and demographics are equally as responsible for maintaining safe and secure internet practices as they so wish. Making practical methods available to the public eye in a more accessible way will allow for a larger more diversified group of individuals to understand internet security and privacy. There are many biases regarding internet privacy and remaining anonymous online, nonetheless, individuals who do not know the opportunities associated with the ability to remain anonymous on the web, deserve to have access to the methods and understanding if they so choose.
